# Conspiracy Questionnaire Game

## Overview

A text-based game in style of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire".

Displays a question and four possible answers, while only one of them is correct.

**Important**
Most questions are conpiracy centric. This is a hard requirement.

## Approach

In order to demonstrate correct, algorithmic thinking and software design, the game will be written in numerous ways:

1. Completely procedural, hard-coded and "WET". (v1)
2. A more function-oriented solution. Practicing the "DRY" principle.
3. An object oriented approach.
